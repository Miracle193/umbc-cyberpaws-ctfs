# Spring 2024 - Week 8: Lost in the Sauce

### Category: OSINT

### Files: meeting_place.png

### Description: 
You have intercepted a photo from a secure channel. It depicts a seemingly abandoned building, but intel suggests it will be the location of a high-level hacker meeting. The problem? There's no location information attached to the photo, but we do know that it was taken in 2011 and that the group likes hanging out by the Mediterranean Sea.

Your mission is to leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to identify the MAJOR CITY nearest to this building. Time is critical! Local authorities need to be alerted before the meeting takes place.

(Note: The flag will be the English name of a major city, in all caps, only letters, no spaces, and should be surrounded by Paws, like so: Paws{NEWDELHI})

### Solution:
From the image given, the abandoned building looks like Pizza Hut. The description also states that the group likes hanging out by the Mediterranean Sea and the language on the street hints that the country is Greece. 

I googled 'abandoned Pizza Hut in Greece' and in Maps the only one is in Athens.

Flag is `Paws{ATHENS}`
