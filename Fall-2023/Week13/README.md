# Fall 2023 - Week 13: Baby's First BinBomb

### Category: Binary Exploitation

### Files: binarybomb

### Description: 
If you're new to binary bombs, this is the perfect start. Your task is to defuse a ticking time bomb by entering the correct input into the command line of a Linux terminal. If the correct input is provided, the bomb diffuses. If not, it explodes!

Run the binary in a Linux terminal, play the game, and solve the questions to get the flag. 

There are two paths: You can try to solve the puzzles and guess your way to safety, or you can dive into the code and figure out the expected inputs
Whether you're a codebreaker or a puzzle solver, this challenge has something for everyone. Good luck and have fun!

### Solution:
For this CTF, I used the first suggested way to solve it by simply answering the trivia questions.

1.  Question 1 answer is b
2. Question 2 answer is base64
3. For question 3, decode the cipher from base64 which translates to "Name the common NSA-built tool for reverse engineering binaries". Answer is “z2hpzhjh” OR “r2hpzhjh”

Flag is `Paws{b1n4ry_b00m!}`
