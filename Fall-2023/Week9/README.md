# Fall 2023 - Week 9: Cryptic Noodle Soup

### Category: Crypto

### Files: CrypticNote.txt

### Description: 
Ever since you were a little kid you've loved the taste of your grandmother's homemade chicken noodle soup.

You've asked her for the recipe for years now. However, she has always denied your request. She never thought you would be responsible with it.

However, one day when you were over at her house, you noticed a note on her table with 1's and 0's. 

Can you figure out the hidden message of this cryptic note? Could this be the recipe?

### Solution:
For this exercise, I used the CyberChef site (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). I copied and pasted the ciphertext form CrypticNote.txt to the CyberChef decoder and used the following tools:
1. From Binary
2. From Morse Code (I set the Word delimiter to Forward slash)
3. From Hex
4. From Base64
5. From ROT13

Flag is: `Paws{Over_My_Dead_Body}`
