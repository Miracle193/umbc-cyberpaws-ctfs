# Fall 2023 - Week 12: More Scodes!

### Category: Audio/Video

### Files: beepboops.mp3

### Description: 
You've received a strange transmission on a UHF radio band, which you've saved to this audio file. It seems almost like there's some pattern to the beeping noises you hear on the frequency, but you're not sure what. 

(The flag will be in upper case only, and contains numbers and letters. Please surround it with Paws{} when submitting!)

### Solution:
After listening to the audio file, it is clear the flag is in morse code. To decode this, I uploaded the .mp3 file to [Morse Code Adaptive Audio Decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).

Flag is `Paws{M0RS3C0D3I5C00L}`
