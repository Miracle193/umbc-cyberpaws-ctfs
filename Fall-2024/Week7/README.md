# Fall 2024 - Week 7: Hash and Dash

### Category: Crypto

### Description:
We recovered some password hashes and wondered if you would be able to recover this one for me?
hash: 367bccf0bdb6ee5570958317591bfd59
All of the other passwords have been pretty commonly used ones.
The flag should be submitted as Paws{*password*}

### Solution:
Navigate to crackstation.net and enter the hash in the text box to crack it.

Flag is `Paws{pondgarden}`
