# Fall 2024 - Week 13: Heap of Studying

### Category: Binary Exploitation

### Files: main.cpp

### Description:
I asked my friend for their notes on process memory but they locked it behind this puzzle that I just cant get past. He gave me an address that the program runs at along side the source file. Can you get around it so that I can check the notes before the final next week?
The process is running at nc 3.145.101.102:53780

### Solution
